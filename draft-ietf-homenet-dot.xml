      <t>
	This document specifies the behavior that is expected from the Domain Name System with
	regard to DNS queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.', and designates this 
	domain as a special-use domain name. 'home.arpa' is designated for non-unique use
	in home networks.   Home Networking Control Protocol (HNCP) is updated to use the
	'.home.arpa' domain instead of '.home'.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
	Users and devices within a home network require devices and services to be identified by names
	that are unique within the boundaries of the home network <xref target="RFC7368"/>. The naming
	mechanism needs to function without configuration from the user. While it may be possible for
	a name to be delegated by an ISP, home networks must also function in the absence of such a
	delegation.  A default name with a scope limited to each individual home network needs to be
	used.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	The '.home.arpa' domain corrects an error in <xref target="RFC7788"/>, replacing '.home'
	as the default domain-name for home networks. '.home' had been selected as the most
	user-friendly option.  However, there are existing uses of '.home' that may be in
	conflict with this use: evidence indicates that '.home' queries frequently leak out and
	reach the root name servers <xref target="ICANN1"/> <xref target="ICANN2"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
	In addition, it's necessary, for compatibility with DNSSEC <xref target="security">,
	that an unsigned delegation be present for the name.  There is an existing process for
	allocating names under '.arpa' <xref target="RFC3172"/>.  No such process is available
	for requesting a similar delegation in the root at the request of the IETF, which does
	not administer that zone.  As a result, the use of '.home' is deprecated.
      </t>

      <t>
	This document registers the domain '.home.arpa.' as a special-use domain name <xref
	target="RFC6761"/> and specifies the behavior that is expected from the Domain Name System
	with regard to DNS queries for names whose rightmost non-terminal labels are '.home.arpa'.
	Queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.' are of local significance within the scope of a
	home network, meaning that identical queries will result in different results from one home
	network to another.  In other words, a name ending in '.home.arpa' is not globally unique.
      </t>

      <t>
	Although this document makes specific reference to RFC7788, it is not intended that
	the use of '.home.arpa' be restricted solely to networks where HNCP is deployed; it is
	rather the case that '.home.arpa' is the correct domain for uses like the one described
	for '.home' in RFC7788.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="guidance" title="General Guidance">
      <t>
	The domain name '.home.arpa.' is to be used for naming within residential home
	networks. Names ending with '.home.arpa.' reference a locally-served zone, the contents of
	which are unique only to a particular home network, and are not globally unique.  Such
	names refer to nodes and/or services that are located within a home network (e.g., a
	printer, or a toaster).
      </t>
      <t>
	DNS queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.' are resolved using local resolvers on the
	homenet.  Such queries MUST NOT be recursively forwarded to servers outside the logical
	boundaries of the home network.
      </t>
      <t>
	Some service discovery user interfaces that are expected to be used on homenets conceal
	information such as domain names from end users.  However, it is still expected that in
	some cases, users will need to see, remember, and even type, names ending with
	'.home.arpa'. It is therefore desirable that users identify the domain and
	understand that using it expresses the intention to connect to a service that is specific
	to the home network to which they are connected.  Enforcing the fulfillment of this
	intention is out of scope for this document.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="considerations" title="Domain Name Reservation Considerations">
      <t>
	This section defines the behavior of systems involved in domain name resolution when
	resolving queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.' (as per <xref target="RFC6761"/>).

	<list style="numbers">
	  <!-- Users -->
	  <t>
	    Users can use names ending with '.home.arpa.' just as they would use any other domain
	    name. The '.home.arpa' name is chosen to be readily recognized by users as signifying that
	    the name is addressing a service on the homenet to which the user's device is connected.
	  </t>

	  <!-- Application Software -->
	  <t>
	    Application software SHOULD NOT handle names ending in '.home.arpa' specially.  In
	    particular, it would not be correct to assign a higher level of trust to such names:
	    although such names might refer to resources on the application user's home network,
	    there is no basis for validating this assumption at a protocol level, and hence such
	    an assumption would create an attack surface for devices roaming to other networks.
	  </t>

	  <!-- Name Resolution APIs and Libraries -->
	  <t>
	    Name resolution APIs and libraries MUST NOT recognize names that end in '.home.arpa.' as
	    special and MUST NOT treat them differently. Name resolution APIs MUST send queries for
	    such names to a recursive DNS server that is configured to be authoritative for the
	    .home.arpa zone appropriate to the home network.  One or more IP addresses for recursive
	    DNS servers will usually be supplied to the client through router advertisements or
	    DHCP.  If a host is configured to use a resolver other than one that is authoritative
	    for the appropriate .home.arpa zone, the client may be unable to resolve, or may receive
	    incorrect results for, names in sub domains of ".home.arpa".
	  </t>

	  <!-- Caching DNS Servers -->
	  <t>
	    Unless specifically configured to serve subdomains of 'home.arpa', recursive
	    resolvers and DNS proxies MUST behave as described in Locally Served Zones (<xref
	    target="RFC6303"/> Section 3). Recursive resolvers that are part of a home network
	    MAY be configured manually or automatically (e.g., for auto-configuration purposes)
	    to act differently, e.g., by querying another name server configured as
	    authoritative for part or all of the '.home.arpa' domain, or proxying the request
	    through a different mechanism.
	  </t>

	  <!-- Authoritative DNS Servers -->
	  <t>
	    Only a DNS server that is authoritative for the '.arpa' zone or is configured to be
	    authoritative for '.home.arpa' or a subdomain of '.home.arpa' will ever answer a
	    query about '.home.arpa.'  In both of these cases, the server should simply answer
	    as configured: no special handling is required.  The delegation returned by servers
	    authoritative for '.arpa' will not match the delegation returned by a local resolver
	    that is actually answering for '.home.arpa.'
	  </t>

	  <!-- DNS Server Operators: -->
	  <t>
	    DNS servers outside a home network should not be configured to be authoritative for .home.arpa.
	  </t>

	  <!-- DNS Registries/Registrars: -->
	  <t>
	    'home.arpa' is a subdomain of the 'arpa' top-level domain, which is operated by IANA
	    under the authority of the Internet Architecture Board according to the rules established
	    in <xref target="RFC3172"/>.  There are no other registrars for .arpa.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Updates to Home Networking Control Protocol">
      <t>
	The final paragraph of Homenet Considerations Protocol <xref target="RFC7788"/>, section
	8, is updated as follows:
      </t>
      <t>
	OLD:
	<list style="empty">
	  <t>
	    Names and unqualified zones are used in an HNCP network to provide naming and service
	    discovery with local significance.  A network-wide zone is appended to all single
	    labels or unqualified zones in order to qualify them. ".home" is the default; however,
	    an administrator MAY configure the announcement of a Domain-Name TLV (Section 10.6)
	    for the network to use a different one.  In case multiple are announced, the domain of
	    the node with the greatest node identifier takes precedence.
	  </t>
	</list>
	NEW:
	<list style="empty">
          <t>
	    Names and unqualified zones are used in an HNCP network to provide naming and service
	    discovery with local significance.  A network-wide zone is appended to all single
	    labels or unqualified zones in order to qualify them. ".home.arpa" is the default;
	    however, an administrator MAY configure the announcement of a Domain-Name TLV (Section
	    10.6) for the network to use a different one.  In case multiple are announced, the
	    domain of the node with the greatest node identifier takes precedence.
	  </t>

          <t>
	    The '.home.arpa' special-use name does not require a special resolution protocol.  Names
	    for which the rightmost two labels are '.home.arpa' are resolved using the DNS
	    protocol <xref target="RFC1035"/>.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	A DNS record that is returned as a response to a query for an FQDN in the domain
	'.home.arpa.'  is expected to have local significance.  It is expected to be returned by
	a server involved in name resolution for the home network the device is connected in.
	However, such response MUST NOT be considered more trustworthy than would be a similar
	response for any other DNS query.
      </t>

      <t>
	Because '.home.arpa' is not globally scoped and cannot be secured using DNSSEC based on the
	root domain's trust anchor, there is no way to tell, using a standard DNS query, in which
	home network scope an answer belongs. Consequently, users may experience surprising results
	with such names when roaming to different home networks.  To prevent this from happening, it
	may be useful for the resolver to identify different home networks on which it has resolved
	names, but this is out of scope for this document.
      </t>

      <t>
	It is not possible to install a trust anchor for this zone in the .ARPA zone.  The reason
	for this is that in order to do so, it would be necessary to have the key-signing key for
	the zone (<xref target="RFC4034"/> Section 5).  Since the zone is not globally unique, no
	one key would work.
      </t>

      <t>
	An alternative would be to install a authenticated denial of existence (<xref
	target="RFC4033"/> Section 3.2).  However, this assumes that validation is being done on
	a caching resolver that is aware of the special local meaning of '.home.arpa'.  If a
	host stub resolver attempts to validate a name in .local.arpa, an authenticated denial
	of existence of 'home' as a subdomain of 'arpa.' would cause the validation to fail.
      </t>

      <t>
	Consequently, unless a trust anchor for the particular instance of the '.home.arpa' zone
	being validated is manually configured on the validating resolver, DNSSEC signing of
	names within the '.home.arpa' zone is not possible.
      </t>

      <t>
	Although in principle it might be useful to install a trust anchor for a particular
	instance of '.home.arpa', it's reasonable to expect that a host with such a trust anchor
	might from time to time connect to more than one network with its own instance of
	'.home.arpa'.   Such a host would be unable to access services on any instance of
	'.home.arpa' other than the one for which a trust anchor was configured.
      </t>

      <t>
	It is in principle possible to attach an identifier to an instance of '.home.arpa' that
	could be used to identify which trust anchor to rely on for validating names in that
	particular instance.  However, the security implications of this are complicated, and
	such a mechanism, as well as a discussion of those implications, is out of scope for
	this document.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Delegation of 'home.arpa'">
      <t>
	In order to be fully functional, there must be a delegation of 'home.arpa' in the
	'.arpa' zone<xref target="RFC3172"/>.  This delegation MUST NOT be signed, MUST NOT
	include a DS record, and MUST point to one or more black hole servers, for example
	BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG and BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG.  The reason that this delegation must not
	be signed is that not signing the delegation breaks the DNSSEC chain of trust, which
	prevents a validating stub resolver from rejecting names published under 'home.arpa' on
	a homenet name server.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
	IANA is requested to record the domain name ".home.arpa" in the Special-Use Domain Names
	registry <xref target="SUDN"/>.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Acknowledgments">
      <t>
	The authors would like to thank Stuart Cheshire for his prior work on '.home', as well as
	the homenet chairs: Mark Townsley and Ray Bellis.   We would also like to thank Paul Hoffman
	for providing review and comments on the IANA considerations section.
