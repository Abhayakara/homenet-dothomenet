    <abstract>
      <t>
	This document specifies the behavior that is expected from the Domain Name System with
	regard to DNS queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.', and designates this 
	domain as a special-use domain name. 'home.arpa.' is designated for non-unique use
	in residential home networks.   Home Networking Control Protocol (HNCP) is updated to use the
	'home.arpa.' domain instead of '.home'.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>
	Users and devices within a home network (hereafter "homenet") require devices and
	services to be identified by names that are unique within the boundaries of the homenet
	<xref target="RFC7368"/>. The naming mechanism needs to function without configuration
	from the user. While it may be possible for a name to be delegated by an ISP, homenets
	must also function in the absence of such a delegation.  A default name with a scope
	limited to each individual homenet needs to be used.
      </t>
      
      <t>
	This document corrects an error in <xref target="RFC7788"/>, replacing '.home' with
	'home.arpa.' as the default domain-name for homenets. '.home' had been selected as the
	most user-friendly option.  However, there are existing uses of '.home' that may be in
	conflict with this use: evidence indicates that '.home' queries frequently leak out and
	reach the root name servers <xref target="ICANN1"/> <xref target="ICANN2"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
	In addition, it's necessary, for compatibility with DNSSEC (<xref target="security"/>),
	that an insecure delegation (<xref target="RFC4035"/> section 4.3) be present for the
	name.  There is an existing process for allocating names under '.arpa' <xref
	target="RFC3172"/>.  No such process is available for requesting a similar delegation in
	the root at the request of the IETF, which does not administer that zone.  As a result,
	the use of '.home' is deprecated.
      </t>

      <t>
	This document registers the domain '.home.arpa.' as a special-use domain name <xref
	target="RFC6761"/> and specifies the behavior that is expected from the Domain Name
	System with regard to DNS queries for names whose rightmost non-terminal labels are
	'home.arpa.'.  Queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.' are of local significance
	within the scope of a homenet, meaning that identical queries will result in different
	results from one homenet to another.  In other words, a name ending in 'home.arpa.' is
	not globally unique.
      </t>

      <t>
	Although this document makes specific reference to RFC7788, it is not intended that
	the use of 'home.arpa.' be restricted solely to networks where HNCP is deployed; it is
	rather the case that 'home.arpa.' is the correct domain for uses like the one described
	for '.home' in RFC7788: local name service in residential homenets.

	The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD

    </section>
    
    <section anchor="guidance" title="General Guidance">
      <t>
	The domain name '.home.arpa.' is to be used for naming within residential
	homenets. Names ending with '.home.arpa.' reference a locally-served zone, the contents
	of which are unique only to a particular homenet, and are not globally unique.  Such
	names refer to nodes and/or services that are located within a homenet (e.g., a printer,
	or a toaster).
      </t>
      <t>
	DNS queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.' are resolved using local resolvers on the
	homenet.  Such queries MUST NOT be recursively forwarded to servers outside the logical
	boundaries of the homenet.
      </t>
      <t>
	Some service discovery user interfaces that are expected to be used on homenets conceal
	information such as domain names from end users.  However, it is still expected that in
	some cases, users will need to see, remember, and even type, names ending with
	'home.arpa.'. It is therefore desirable that users identify the domain and
	understand that using it expresses the intention to connect to a service that is specific
	to the homenet to which they are connected.  Enforcing the fulfillment of this
	intention is out of scope for this document.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="considerations" title="Domain Name Reservation Considerations">
      <t>
	This section defines the behavior of systems involved in domain name resolution when
	resolving queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.' (as per <xref target="RFC6761"/>).

	<list style="numbers">
	  <!-- Users -->
	  <t>
	    Users can use names ending with '.home.arpa.' just as they would use any other domain
	    name. The 'home.arpa.' name is chosen to be readily recognized by users as signifying that
	    the name is addressing a service on the homenet to which the user's device is connected.
	  </t>

	  <!-- Application Software -->
	  <t>
	    Application software SHOULD NOT treat names ending in 'home.arpa.' differently than
	    other names.  In particular, there is no basis for trusting names that are subdomains
	    of 'home.arpa.' (see <xref target="security"/>).
	  </t>

	  <!-- Name Resolution APIs and Libraries -->
	  <t>
	    Name resolution APIs and libraries MUST NOT recognize names that end in '.home.arpa.' as
	    special and MUST NOT treat them differently. Name resolution APIs MUST send queries for
	    such names to a recursive DNS server that is configured to be authoritative for the
	    'home.arpa.' zone appropriate to the homenet.  One or more IP addresses for recursive
	    DNS servers will usually be supplied to the client through router advertisements or
	    DHCP.  If a host is configured to use a resolver other than one that is authoritative
	    for the appropriate 'home.arpa.' zone, the client may be unable to resolve, or may receive
	    incorrect results for, names in sub domains of 'home.arpa.'.
	  </t>

	  <!-- Caching DNS Servers -->
	  <t>
	    Recursive resolvers conforming to this specification MUST support DNSSEC queries.
	    While validation is not required, it is strongly encouraged; a caching resolver
	    that does not validate answers that can be validated may cache invalid data; this
	    will prevent validating stub resolvers from successfully validating answers.
	    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
	    Unless configured otherwise, recursive resolvers and DNS proxies MUST behave as
	    described in Locally Served Zones (<xref target="RFC6303"/> Section 3).  That is,
	    queries for domains that are subdomains of 'home.arpa.' MUST NOT be forwarded, with
	    one important exception: a query for a DS record when the DO bit (<xref
	    target="RFC4035"/> section 3.2.1) set MUST return the correct answer for that
	    question, including correct information in the authority section that proves that
	    the record is nonexistent.
	    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
	    So for example a query for the NS record for 'home.arpa.' MUST NOT result in that
	    query being forwarded to an upstream cache nor to the authoritative DNS server for
	    '.arpa.'.  However, as necessary to provide accurate authority information, a query
	    for the DS record MUST result in whatever queries are necessary being forwarded;
	    typically, this will just be a query for the DS record, since the necessary
	    authority information will be included in the authority section of the response
	    if the DO bit is set.
	    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
	    In addition to the behavior specified above, recursive resolvers that can be used in
	    a homenet MUST be configurable with a delegation to an authoritative server for that
	    particular homenet's instance of the domain 'home.arpa.'.
	    <vspace blankLines="1"/>
	    It is permissible to combine the recursive resolver function for general DNS
	    lookups with an authoritative resolver for 'home.arpa.'; in this case, rather
	    than forwarding queries for subdomains of 'home.arpa.' to an authoritative server,
	    the caching resolver answers them authoritatively.   The behavior with respect
	    to forwarding queries specifically for 'home.arpa.' remains the same.
	  </t>

	  <!-- Authoritative DNS Servers -->
	  <t>
	    No special processing of 'home.arpa.' is required for authoritative DNS server
	    implementations.  It is possible that an authoritative DNS server might attempt
	    to check the authoritative servers for 'home.arpa.' for a delegation beneath that
	    name before answering authoritatively for such a delegated name.  In such a case,
	    because the name always has only local significance there will be no such delegation
	    in the 'home.arpa.' zone, and so the server would refuse to answer authoritatively
	    for such a zone.  A server that implements this sort of check MUST be configurable
	    so that either it does not do this check for the 'home.arpa.' domain, or it ignores
	    the results of the check.
	  </t>

	  <!-- DNS Server Operators: -->
	  <t>
	    DNS server operators MAY configure an authoritative server for 'home.arpa.' for use
	    in homenets and other home networks.  The operator for the DNS servers authoritative
	    for 'home.arpa.' in the global DNS will configure any such servers as described in
	    <xref target="delegation"/>.
	  </t>

	  <!-- DNS Registries/Registrars: -->
	  <t>
	    'home.arpa.' is a subdomain of the 'arpa' top-level domain, which is operated by IANA
	    under the authority of the Internet Architecture Board according to the rules established
	    in <xref target="RFC3172"/>.  There are no other registrars for .arpa.
	  </t>
	</list>

    <section title="Updates to Home Networking Control Protocol">
      <t>
	The final paragraph of Home Networking Control Protocol <xref target="RFC7788"/>, section
	8, is updated as follows:
      </t>
      <t>
	OLD:
	<list style="empty">
	  <t>
	    Names and unqualified zones are used in an HNCP network to provide naming and service
	    discovery with local significance.  A network-wide zone is appended to all single
	    labels or unqualified zones in order to qualify them. ".home" is the default; however,
	    an administrator MAY configure the announcement of a Domain-Name TLV (Section 10.6)
	    for the network to use a different one.  In case multiple are announced, the domain of
	    the node with the greatest node identifier takes precedence.
	  </t>
	</list>
	NEW:
	<list style="empty">

          <t>
	    The 'home.arpa.' special-use name does not require a special resolution protocol.  Names
	    for which the rightmost two labels are 'home.arpa.' are resolved using the DNS
	    protocol <xref target="RFC1035"/>.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	A DNS record that is returned as a response to a query for an FQDN in the domain
	'.home.arpa.'  is expected to have local significance.  It is expected to be returned by
	a server involved in name resolution for the homenet the device is connected in.
	However, such response MUST NOT be considered more trustworthy than would be a similar
	response for any other DNS query.
      </t>

      <t>
	Because 'home.arpa.' is not globally scoped and cannot be secured using DNSSEC based on the
	root domain's trust anchor, there is no way to tell, using a standard DNS query, in which
	homenet scope an answer belongs. Consequently, users may experience surprising results
	with such names when roaming to different homenets.  To prevent this from happening, it
	may be useful for the resolver to identify different homenets on which it has resolved
	names, but this is out of scope for this document.
      </t>

      <t>
	It is not possible to install a trust anchor for this zone in the '.arpa' zone.  The reason
	for this is that in order to do so, it would be necessary to have the key-signing key for
	the zone (<xref target="RFC4034"/> Section 5).  Since the zone is not globally unique, no
	one key would work.
      </t>

      <t>
	An alternative would be to install a authenticated denial of existence (<xref
	target="RFC4033"/> Section 3.2).  However, this assumes that validation is being done on
	a caching resolver that is aware of the special local meaning of 'home.arpa.'.  If a
	host stub resolver attempts to validate a name in 'home.arpa.', an authenticated denial
	of existence of 'home' as a subdomain of 'arpa.' would cause the validation to fail.
        Therefore, the only delegation that will allow names under 'home.arpa.' to be resolved
        is an insecure delegation, as in <xref target="RFC6303"/> section 7.
      </t>

      <t>
	Consequently, unless a trust anchor for the particular instance of the 'home.arpa.' zone
	being validated is manually configured on the validating resolver, DNSSEC signing of
	names within the 'home.arpa.' zone is not possible.
      </t>

      <t>
	Although in principle it might be useful to install a trust anchor for a particular
	instance of 'home.arpa.', it's reasonable to expect that a host with such a trust anchor
	might from time to time connect to more than one network with its own instance of
	'home.arpa.'.   Such a host would be unable to access services on any instance of
	'home.arpa.' other than the one for which a trust anchor was configured.
      </t>

      <t>
	It is in principle possible to attach an identifier to an instance of 'home.arpa.' that
	could be used to identify which trust anchor to rely on for validating names in that
	particular instance.  However, the security implications of this are complicated, and
	such a mechanism, as well as a discussion of those implications, is out of scope for
	this document.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="delegation" title="Delegation of 'home.arpa.'">
      <t>
	In order to be fully functional, there must be a delegation of 'home.arpa.' in the
	'.arpa.' zone <xref target="RFC3172"/>.  This delegation MUST NOT include a DS record,
	and MUST point to one or more black hole servers, for example 'blackhole-1.iana.org.'
	and 'blackhole-2.iana.org.'.  The reason that this delegation must not be signed is that
	not signing the delegation breaks the DNSSEC chain of trust, which prevents a validating
	stub resolver from rejecting names published under 'home.arpa.' on a homenet name
	server.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
	IANA is requested to record the domain name 'home.arpa.' in the Special-Use Domain Names
	registry <xref target="SUDN"/>.  IANA is requested, with the approval of IAB, to
	implement the delegation requested in <xref target="delegation"/>.
      </t>
