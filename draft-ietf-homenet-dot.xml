<abstract>
  <t>
    This document specifies the behavior that is expected from the Domain Name System with
    regard to DNS queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.', and designates this top-level
    domain as a special-use domain name. The '.home.arpa' top-level domain replaces '.home' as the
    default domain used by the Home Networking Control Protocol (HNCP).

<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
  <t>
    Users and devices within a home network require devices and services to be identified by names
    that are unique within the boundaries of the home network <xref target="RFC7368"/>. The naming
    mechanism needs to function without configuration from the user. While it may be possible for
    a name to be delegated by an ISP, home networks must also function in the absence of such a
    delegation.  A default name with a scope limited to each individual home network needs to be
    used.
  </t>
    
  <t>
    The '.home.arpa' top-level domain replaces '.home' which was specified in <xref
    target="RFC7788"/> as the default domain-name for home networks. '.home' had been selected
    as the most user-friendly option.  However, there are existing uses of '.home' that may be
    in conflict with this use: evidence indicates that '.home' queries frequently leak out and
    reach the root name servers <xref target="ICANN1"/> <xref target="ICANN2"/>.  Also, ICANN
    has about a dozen applicants for the '.home' top-level domain name, which creates a
    significant risk of litigation if it were claimed by the IETF outside of that process.  As a
    result, the use of '.home' has been deprecated; this document updates <xref
    target="RFC7788"/> to replace '.home' with '.home.arpa', while another document, <xref
    target="I-D.ietf-homenet-redact"/> deprecates the use of the '.home' TLD.
  </t>

  <t>
    This document registers the top-level domain '.home.arpa.' as a special-use domain name <xref
    target="RFC6761"/> and specifies the behavior that is expected from the Domain Name System
    with regard to DNS queries for names whose rightmost non-terminal label is 'homenet'.
    Queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.' are of local significance within the scope of a
    home network, meaning that identical queries will result in different results from one home
    network to another.  In other words, a name ending in '.home.arpa' is not globally unique.
  </t>
</section>

<section anchor="guidance" title="General Guidance">
    <t>
      The top-level domain name '.home.arpa.' is to be used for naming within a home
      network. Names ending with '.home.arpa.' reference a locally-served zone, the contents of
      which are unique only to a particular home network, and are not globally unique.  Such
      names refer to nodes and/or services that are located within a home network (e.g., a
      printer, or a toaster).
    </t>
    <t>
      DNS queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.' are resolved using local resolvers on the
      homenet.  Such queries MUST NOT be recursively forwarded to servers outside the logical
      boundaries of the home network.
    </t>
    <t>
      Some service discovery user interfaces that are expected to be used on homenets conceal
      information such as domain names from end users.  However, it is still expected that in
      some cases, users will need to see, remember, and even type, names ending with
      '.home.arpa'. It is therefore desirable that users identify the top-level domain and
      understand that using it expresses the intention to connect to a service that is specific
      to the home network to which they are connected.  Enforcing the fulfillment of this
      intention is out of scope for this document.
    </t>
</section>

<section anchor="considerations" title="Domain Name Reservation Considerations">
  <t>
    This section defines the behavior of systems involved in domain name resolution when serving
    queries for names ending with '.home.arpa.' (as per <xref target="RFC6761"/>).

    <list style="numbers">
      <!-- Users -->
      <t>
	Users can use names ending with '.home.arpa.' just as they would use any other domain
	name. The '.home.arpa' name is chosen to be readily recognized by users as signifying that
	the name is addressing a service on the homenet to which the user's device is connected.
      </t>

      <!-- Application Software -->
      <t>
	Applications SHOULD treat domain names ending with '.home.arpa.' just like any other FQDN,
	and MUST NOT make any assumption on the level of additional security implied by its
	presence.
      </t>

      <!-- Name Resolution APIs and Libraries -->
      <t>
	Name resolution APIs and libraries MUST NOT recognize names that end in '.home.arpa.' as
	special and MUST NOT treat them differently. Name resolution APIs MUST send queries for
	such names to a recursive DNS server that is configured to be authoritative for the
	.home.arpa zone appropriate to the home network.  One or more IP addresses for recursive
	DNS servers will usually be supplied to the client through router advertisements or
	DHCP.  If a host is configured to use a resolver other than one that is authoritative
	for the appropriate .home.arpa zone, the client may be unable to resolve, or may receive
	incorrect results for, names in sub domains of ".home.arpa".
      </t>

      <!-- Caching DNS Servers -->
      <t>
	Unless configured otherwise, recursive resolvers and DNS proxies MUST behave as
	described in Locally Served Zones (<xref target="RFC6303"/> Section 3). Recursive
	resolvers that are part of a home network MAY be configured manually or automatically
	(e.g., for auto-configuration purposes) to act differently, e.g., by querying another
	name server configured as authoritative for part or all of the '.home.arpa' domain, or
	proxying the request through a different mechanism.
      </t>

      <!-- Authoritative DNS Servers -->
      <t>
	Only a DNS server that is authoritative for the '.arpa' zone or is configured to be
	authoritative for '.home.arpa' or a subdomain of '.home.arpa' will ever answer a query about
	'.home.arpa.'  In both of these cases, the server should simply answer as configured: no
	special handling is required.
      </t>

      <!-- DNS Server Operators: -->
      <t>
	DNS servers outside a home network should not be configured to be authoritative for .home.arpa.
      </t>

      <!-- DNS Registries/Registrars: -->
      <t>
        DNS Registries/Registrars MUST NOT grant requests to register '.home.arpa' in the normal
        way to any person or entity.  '.home.arpa' MUST BE registered in perpetuity to IANA, and
	IANA MUST maintain nameservers for the zone.
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>
</section>

<section title="Updates to Home Networking Control Protocol">
    <t>
      The final paragraph of Homenet Considerations Protocol <xref target="RFC7788"/>, section
      8, is updated as follows:
    </t>
    <t>
      OLD:
      <list style="empty">
	<t>
	  Names and unqualified zones are used in an HNCP network to provide naming and service
	  discovery with local significance.  A network-wide zone is appended to all single
	  labels or unqualified zones in order to qualify them. ".home" is the default; however,
	  an administrator MAY configure the announcement of a Domain-Name TLV (Section 10.6)
	  for the network to use a different one.  In case multiple are announced, the domain of
	  the node with the greatest node identifier takes precedence.
	</t>
      </list>
      NEW:
      <list style="empty">
        <t>
	  Names and unqualified zones are used in an HNCP network to provide naming and service
	  discovery with local significance.  A network-wide zone is appended to all single
	  labels or unqualified zones in order to qualify them. ".home.arpa" is the default;
	  however, an administrator MAY configure the announcement of a Domain-Name TLV (Section
	  10.6) for the network to use a different one.  In case multiple are announced, the
	  domain of the node with the greatest node identifier takes precedence.
	</t>

        <t>
	  The '.home.arpa' special-use name does not require a special resolution protocol.  Names
	  for which the rightmost non-terminal label is 'homenet' are resolved using the DNS
	  protocol <xref target="RFC1035"/>.
	</t>
      </list>
    </t>
</section>

<section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
  <t>
    A DNS record that is returned as a response to a query ending with '.home.arpa.' is expected
    to have local significance.  It is expected to be returned by a server involved in name
    resolution for the home network the device is connected in.  However, such response MUST NOT
    be considered more trustworthy than would be a similar response for any other DNS query.
  </t>

  <t>
    Because '.home.arpa' is not globally scoped and cannot be secured using DNSSEC based on the
    root domain's trust anchor, there is no way to tell, using a standard DNS query, in which
    home network scope an answer belongs. Consequently, users may experience surprising results
    with such names when roaming to different home networks.  To prevent this from happening, it
    may be useful for the resolver to identify different home networks on which it has resolved
    names, but this is out of scope for this document.
  </t>

  <t>
    In order to enable DNSSEC validation of a particular '.home.arpa', it might make sense to
    configure a trust anchor for that homenet.   How this might be done is out of scope for
    this document.
  </t>
</section>

<section title="Delegation of 'home.arpa'">
  <t>
    In order to be fully functional, there must be a delegation of 'home.arpa' in the '.arpa'
    zone.  This delegation MUST NOT be signed, MUST NOT include a DS record, and MUST point to
    one or more black hole servers, for example BLACKHOLE-1.IANA.ORG and BLACKHOLE-2.IANA.ORG.
    The reason that this delegation must not be signed is that not signing the delegation breaks
    the DNSSEC chain of trust, which prevents a validating stub resolver from rejecting names
    published under 'home.arpa' on a homenet name server.
  </t>
</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
  <t>
    IANA is requested to record the domain name ".home.arpa" in the Special-Use Domain Names
    registry <xref target="SUDN"/>.
  </t>
</section>

<section title="Acknowledgments">
  <t>
    The authors would like to thank Stuart Cheshire for his prior work on '.home', as well as
    the homenet chairs: Mark Townsley and Ray Bellis.   We would also like to thank Paul Hoffman
    for providing review and comments on the IANA considerations section.
